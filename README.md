**Phink** provides a convenient wrapper around [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) to make project documentation a breeze.

* Super easy to setup and build
* Write your docs in [Markdown](https://recommonmark.readthedocs.io)
* Automatically [rebuild and reload](https://livereload.readthedocs.io) during development
* Extract docstrings for [API documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html)

Read the full [Phink documentation](https://phink.readthedocs.io/) to learn more.

## Installation
```sh
    pip install phink
```

## Getting Started

**Create** a set of sample documentation files:

```sh
    cd your_project_directory
    phink init
```

**Build** and serve the HTML output:

```sh
    phink serve
```

**Edit** the files in the `doc/` directory to your liking.
The documentation will be rebuilt and reloaded automatically in your browser.

**Commit** and push to your Git repository.
Make sure you don't commit the `doc/_build` directory.

**Publish** to ReadTheDocs by following the [RTD import documentation](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/import-guide.html).
